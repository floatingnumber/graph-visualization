# graph-visualization
A force-directed layout algorithm to more easily and intuitively see complex nodal relationships in a graph. It reads in data about nodes and edges from a file, initializes their position in a circle in a graphical window, calculates attractive and repulsive forces according to the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, and updates nodal positions according to each node's net forces.
